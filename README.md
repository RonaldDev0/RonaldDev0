# Hello, I'm Ronald Zamora! 👨‍💻

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer and Full-Stack Web Developer with a passion for turning ideas into innovative, scalable digital solutions. I've independently developed high-impact projects that showcase my ability to manage complex initiatives from start to finish.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎥 Streamingx
A **streaming platform** similar to YouTube, built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. I implemented **API Routes** for seamless internal communication, using **Supabase** as the database and **Cloudflare R2** to efficiently host and serve videos at scale.

### 🍽️ Foodllowers
An **innovative ecosystem** akin to Rappi that leverages influencers to boost sales. I developed multiple specialized **PWAs**—one for customers, one for influencers, one for kitchens, and one for delivery personnel—all connected via a robust backend implemented with **Supabase**. The solution also integrates **MercadoPago** for payment processing and **Google Maps APIs** to optimize routes and maps.
